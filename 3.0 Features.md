## Features for 3.0
* Start moving code base for compatibility for .Net Core and PowerShell Core by migrating APIs and calls. Not a target for full support for .Net core in this release.
* Support for quoting in SCP so as to support Cisco and other devices better.
* Add thumbprint as as parameter for the connection cmdlets. 
* Remove dependency of the registry for known hosts and move it to a file that uses the same format as OpenSSH.
